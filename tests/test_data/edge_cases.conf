# Test overlapping patterns with different notations
# These should be matched in order, with first match taking precedence
1v: echo explicit press
1^: echo explicit release

# Test mixed notation in same line (should take precedence over simpler patterns)
1v,2,3^: echo mixed notation

# Test simple patterns
1: echo shorthand press and release
1,2: echo normal line

# Test comments and whitespace handling
  2v:   echo spaces before pattern    # Comment with spaces
3v:     echo spaces after pattern
	4v:	echo tabs and spaces	# Tab-indented line

# Test empty lines and comment-only lines
# Just a comment line

# Test equivalent patterns written differently
2,2: echo double press explicit
2 < 0.5: echo double press shorthand

# Test potentially conflicting sequences
1,2,3: echo sequence one
2,3,1: echo sequence two  # Different start point but same buttons
3,2,1: echo sequence three  # Reverse order

# Test boundary timing cases
1,2 < 0.001: echo extremely fast
1,2 < 999.999: echo extremely slow

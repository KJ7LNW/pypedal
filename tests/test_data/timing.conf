# Test timing constraints with priority order
# More specific/restrictive patterns should be first

# Test priority with same sequence but different timing
# More restrictive timing should be checked first
1,2,3 < 0.2: echo very fast sequence
1,2,3 < 0.5: echo moderately fast sequence
1,2,3 < 1.0: echo slow sequence

# Fast sequences (under 0.2 seconds)
1,2 < 0.2: echo fast two button
1,2,3 < 0.2: echo fast three button
1,2,3,2,1 < 0.2: echo fast five button

# Medium speed sequences (under 0.5 seconds)
1,2 < 0.5: echo medium two button
1,2,3 < 0.5: echo medium three button

# Slow sequences (under 1 second)
1,2 < 1.0: echo slow two button
